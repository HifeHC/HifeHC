### Navigating My OS on the Command Line

1. Full / absolute path to your user's home directory:         cd $home
2. Create a directory named `DirA`:                            mkdir DirA
3. Create a directory named `Dir B`:                           mkdir "Dir B"
4. Go into `DirA`:                                             cd DirA
5. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`:                                cd "..\Dir B"
6. Return to your user's home directory:                       cd $home
7. Create a file named `test.txt`:                             New-Item test.txt
8. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`:                 Move-Item test.txt DirA
9. Contents of `test.txt`:                                     notepad DirA\test.txt
```
                                                               Hello, my name is Hudson.
```
10. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`:      Copy-Item DirA\test.txt DirA\copy.txt
11. View the contents of `DirA`:                               Get-ChildItem DirA
12. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`:   Copy-Item DirA\test.txt "Dir B\fodder.txt"
13. Delete / remove both `fodder.txt` AND `Dir B`:             Remove-Item "Dir B\fodder.txt"
                                                               Remove-Item "Dir B"
